## App description and functionality overview

This react app displays a leaderboard for a Padel league, it also has the ability of filtering over the teams rankings. 
It's usage is meant for a frontend interview at PlaybyPoint.

## Install

Go to [PBP-LEADERBOARD-APP](https://github.com/InNominePatris/PBP-LEADERBOARD-APP.git) and clone it on your pc.

- Once cloned, navigate to the app folder of PBP-LEADERBOARD-APP
- Open a terminal and type `npm install` (This should install all the dependencies).

Once installed you should start the **json-server** to handle the data in the app. 

- Open another terminal and paste the following command `npx json-server --watch db.json` (This command starts the json server)
  If you're worriying about why are we using **npx** instead of **npm** to start the server it's just because json-server was installed at a level project and not globally.
  
- After having started the json server in the previous console, execute the `npm run dev` command and the application is ready for usage.
